3) What you have done in the assignment
	- In this assignment I have almost created a server and client connection to gather data from a server to client
4) What your code files are and what each one does (please do not repeat the project description, just
name your code files and briefly mention their purpose)
	- I did not create any other code files other than what was asked of in the project description. 
5) Any idiosyncrasies of your project, including under what conditions the project might fail, if any
	- My file cannot establish a client to server connection on my computer. Ive tried serval things but could not get it to work. 
6) Reused code: Did you use code from anywhere for your project? If not, state that. If so, specify
what functions were reused and where theyâ€™re from (also include comments in the source code to identify reused sections).
I used example code from geeks for geeks.org for client and  server connection
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-in-cpp/
I also used my previous read file from the last lab buttweeked it a little.
