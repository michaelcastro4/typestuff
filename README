1) Your full name as given in the class list
	- Michael Castro
2) Your student ID
	- 7943201471
3) What you have done in the assignment
	- In this assignment I have created two ways of verifing if a string of code is free of any errors through the use of CRC-16 and Checksum functions. 
4) What your code files are and what each one does (please do not repeat the project description, just
name your code files and briefly mention their purpose)
	- I did not create any other code files other than what was asked of in the project description. 
5) Any idiosyncrasies of your project, including under what conditions the project might fail, if any
	- I am unaware of my code not performing its function in my following code. If anything, I am concerned the most with the code being converted to the string containing the errors, and then performing checksum and crc-16. That is what I struggled with the most on this project.
6) Reused code: Did you use code from anywhere for your project? If not, state that. If so, specify
what functions were reused and where theyâ€™re from (also include comments in the source code to identify reused sections).
	- // For the bitset library I found an example on geeksforgeeks.org where you can easily turn a number into a value of bits in which I use for checksum to make the represenation of crc very easy,exact link: 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-bitset-and-its-application/'
	For the readfile operation used in the very beginning, I had issues when it came to my code reading the data.txt file. I followed an example on the stackoverflow website that showcased how to read desired files/desired lines of a file, exact link: 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19123334/how-to-use-stdgetline-to-read-a-text-file-into-an-array-of-strings-in-c'
	Lastly, other than the suggested library list, all my code was constructed by me.
